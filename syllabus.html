<h1>Course Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/quest">QuEST</a> Foundations of Quantitative Reasoning course. This course is designed to provide students with a solid background in both ecology and evolution as well as commonly used quantitative tools. By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>
<div id="concepts" class="section level3">
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand basic concepts in population and community ecology</li>
<li>Compare and contrast different modeling philosophies</li>
<li>Analyze simple population models using qualitative approaches</li>
<li>Use linear algebra to construct and analyze structured population models</li>
<li>Understand foundations of spatial ecology and build simple models</li>
<li>Compare and contrast hypotheses that attempt to explain basic patterns in biodiversity.</li>
<li>Understand principles of evolution and natural selection</li>
<li>Understand and apply various tools to understand evolution (population genetics, quantitative genetics, and game theory)</li>
<li>Understand and apply simple models to study infectious disease dynamics</li>
<li>Describe how humans affect ecological and evolutionary dynamics</li>
<li>Read and discuss papers that involve modeling</li>
<li>Construct and program simple population models in R</li>
<li>Understand and apply a variety of mathematical tools (equilibrium and stability analysis, linear algebra, stochastic models, etc.)</li>
<li>Work in small, collaborative groups to find solutions to particular case studies.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="skills" class="section level3">
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>This is clearly a lot of objectives and material to cover in one semester. However, there will be lots of time to ask questions and to have discussions. The format of the class will change from day to day, but will include a combination of lecturing, problem-solving activities, discussions, and working in small groups.</p>
<p>As a four-credit course, you should expect do spend at least six hours a week reading and working on problems. The more time and effort you put in, the more you will get out of this course.</p>
<p>Any and all of the content of this syllabus is subject to change as we go through the course. The material will be tailored to fit the needs of the class. Changes will be announced in-class and electronically.</p>

<h1>Course resources</h1>
<div id="your-classmates" class="section level4">
<h4>Your classmates</h4>
<p>By its very nature, this course will challenge each student during different points. The ecology and evolution may be challenging for those with little biology background and the quantitative skills may be difficult to pick up for those of you with traditional biology backgrounds. It will be essential to work with others on assignments—just be sure that you understand the material yourself.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-instuctor" class="section level4">
<h4>Your instuctor</h4>
<p>I will hold office hours several times per week and I am always happy to set up additional times to meet. Please ask for help, early and often. If you have a question, others in the class surely have the same one. At any point, please reach out to let me know how I might improve the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-office-hours" class="section level4">
<h4>R office hours</h4>
<p>In addition to normal office hours, every other week there will be an R work time in Jeffords. This is a time to get help on R for this class, other classes, or for your research. Occasionally, mini-workshops on various R topics will also be taught during this time.</p>
</div>
<div id="various-textbooks" class="section level4">
<h4>Various textbooks</h4>
<p>This course will not follow any particular textbook. However, I will draw from several books and online sources:</p>

<div id="various-online-tools" class="section level4">
<h4>Various online tools</h4>
<p>Calculus a bit rusty? Maybe you’re not totally remembering Mendelian genetics? Something else? We will walk through topics from the beginning, but there might be points that still seem confusing. Besides your classmates and instructor, there are a plethora of online tools to help provide a quick refresher:</p>

<h1>Grading Standards and Practices</h1>
<div id="problem-sets-12-5-points-each" class="section level4">
<h4>Problem sets: 12 @ 5 points each</h4>
<p>Every week there will be assigned problem sets. These will involve a mix of math done on paper and programming in R. The problem sets will either be turned in on paper or on Github depending on the assignment. Some problem sets will be individual-based and others will be in small teams.</p>
</div>
<div id="group-project-30-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Group project: 30 points</h4>
<p>The final project will involve building a model to understand some system. The choice of system, modeling approach, and question will be up to each team. The teams will be between 2-3 students. Think of this project as an opportunity that could lead to a publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="teaching-a-lesson-30-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Teaching a lesson: 30 points</h4>
<p>Everyone will be expected to teach one class (or lab) during the course of the semester. The specific lesson will be chosen by the student. The student will work with the instructor to design the lesson in line with learning outcomes for the course.</p>

<div id="academic-honesty" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic honesty</h1>
<p>Students in the class are expected to complete their own work. It is encouraged that you work with other students outside of class, but your completed work must be from you and in your own words. Students are expected to follow UVM policy on plagiarism, fabrication, collusion, and cheating: <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/policies/student/acadintegrity.pdf" class="uri">http://www.uvm.edu/policies/student/acadintegrity.pdf</a>.</p>

<div id="student-learning-accomadations" class="section level1">
<h1>Student Learning Accomadations</h1>
<p>In keeping with University policy, any student with a documented disability interested in utilizing accommodations should contact SAS, the office of Disability Services on campus. SAS works with students and faculty in an interactive process to explore reasonable and appropriate accommodations, which are communicated to faculty in an accommodation letter. All students are strongly encouraged to meet with their faculty to discuss the accommodations they plan to use in each course. A student’s accommodation letter lists those accommodations that will not be implemented until the student meets with their faculty to create a plan. Contact SAS: A170 Living/Learning Center; 802-656-7753.</p>
